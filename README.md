# HTTP Driver for Kipchak

This is a file based caching driver for Kipchak. It's based on the Symfony Cache Component `symfony/cache`.

#### Composer Package 

`kipchak/driver-filecache`

#### Sample Config File:

This driver does not require any configuration.

## How to use it?

Install it via composer: `composer require kipchak/driver-filecache`.

### Example Usage

```php
// Load the HTTP driver.
$cache = Kipchak\Driver\Filecache\Filecache::get()
// Use the $cache client as you would the Symfony Cache Component.
```

## What is a Kipchak Driver?

Kipchak Drivers are used to connect Kipchak to various data sources or storage systems.

They provide a standardized interface for interacting with different data sources, allowing developers to
focus on building their applications rather than dealing with the complexities of each data source.

Drivers were introduced as a part of the Kipchak 2.0 release.

Drivers are basically Container Dependencies injected into Kipchak's Service Container.

## How do Kipchak Drivers work?

Some Kipchak drivers are wired into the Service Container via a config file (where required).

If applicable, you will find a sample config file in this repository as well as in the starter project at https://1x.ax/mamluk/kipchak/starter.

Each driver defines an implementation of Kipchak's Driver Interface. Where applicable, the dependency may
accept a parameter for a specific instance of the driver specified as a config property, for instance, in the case
of multiple database connections or S3 buckets.

So you may access the driver by invoking \Mamluk\Kipchak\Driver\Memcached\Memcached::get('cache'), where
`cache` is the name of one of the memcached connection pools specified in the config file.
